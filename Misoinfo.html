    <div class="description">He is orange<br> 
        smelly<br>
        and not too bright.
    <br><br>
    playing with laser pointers<br>
    is his favorite activity.<br><br>

    he will run into things,<br>
    BONK his head on furniture,<br> abandon all worldly desires, <br>all to chase that <br><i>glorious, glorious</i> <b style="text-shadow: red 1px 0 10px;">glowing dot</b>.
    <br><br>
    So for his safety, <br>(and my sanity),<br> I decided to make an infinite laser game for him, <br>one that will keep track of his scores and go on forever, <br>so he can play to his heart's content <br>without injuring himself <br>(OR my things).
    <br><br>
    <div class="monologue">I really hope he will actually use this,
    fingers crossed<br>
    hehehehheheehhe
