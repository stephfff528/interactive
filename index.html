      Welcome visitors: this is a website I made during the spring of 2023, for ART 369 Interactive Design and the Internet: Software for People. After learning to code twice and giving up both times (lol) I'm finally able to create my own responsive webpages! I hope you stay a while and interact with some of the sites here. Have fun <3

    Hi there! I'm Stephanie. I am an undergraduate student at Yale University studying Graphic Design and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. After two years of *internal turmoil* and *self doubt*, I finally found the courage to pursue my passion in both STEM and creative arts! I was born and raised in Queens, NYC, but I have also spent some time studying in Shanghai, China. <br><br>

    My work as an artist centers around vulnerability, regardless of medium. Long, tangling strands of yarn, crisp, freshly printed stacks of posters, RGB pixels on computer screens, they are all tools I utilize to present snippets of myself to my audiences: my joys, pains, and triumphs. As a queer woman of color and daughter of Chinese immigrants, I am on a continuous journey of exploring my personal identity, embracing my fears and anxieties, and reconciling with pains of the past. I strive to utilize my artistic practice as a way for myself and others to reflect upon the human experience in all its glory, to appreciate even the smallest moments of happiness, and to provide respite from sorrow and loss. <br><br>

    I am also interested in documenting the human process of metamorphosis through transformative periods in one’s lifetime; specifically how we as people are constantly being reshaped by our experiences, broken down by moments of fear, pain, and anger, and then rebuilt on a molecular level. I explore how our very being is reconstructed during formative events: the unraveling of our soul, the struggle to keep afloat, and the eventual moment of long-awaited growth. My work is a celebration of life’s unpredictabilities,  a reminder to lean in and embrace the hard times, and learning to surf their torrential waters instead of drowning. <br><br>

    I am currently located in New Haven, where I live with my silly orange cat Miso!
