  <h1> Sea <br> Urchin</h1>
  <h3> Chang-rae Lee </h3>


  <div style="background-color: purple;color: lightyellow;">
  July, 1980. <br>
  I'm about to turn fifteen and our family is in Seoul, the first
  time since we left, twelve years earlier. <br> 
  I don't know if it's different.<br>
  My parents can't really say. <br>
  They just repeat the equivalent of <i>"How in the world?" </i> whenever we venture into another part of the city, or meet one of their old friends. <br><br>

  "Look at that—how in the world?" <br><br>
  "This hot spell, yes,yes—how in the world?" <br><br>

  My younger sister is very quiet in the astounding heat. We all are.<br>
  It's the first time I notice how I <b style="color: darkkhaki;">stink</b>.<br>
  You can't help smelling like everything else. <br>
  And in the heat everything smells of <i style="color: darkkhaki;">ferment and rot and rankness</i>.<br>
  In my grandfather's old neighborhood, where the two- and three-room houses stand barely head-high,the smell is staggering.

  </div> <br><br>
  

  <div style="background-color: lightsalmon;">
  "What's that?" I ask. <br><br>
  My cousin says, "<i style="color: brown;">Shit.</i>"<br><br>
  "Shit? What shit?"<br><br>
  "Yours," he says, laughing. "Mine."

  </div> <br><br> 

  <div style="background-color: lavender;" >
  On the wide streets near the city center, there are student demonstrations;<br>
  my cousin says they're a response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju_Uprising">a massacre of citizens by the military down south in Kwangju.</a><br>
  After the riot troops clear the avenues, the air is laden with tear gas—"<b style="color: red">spicy</b>," in the idiom. <br>
  Whenever we're in a taxi,moving through there, I open the window and stick out my tongue, trying
  to taste <i style="color: red">the poison, the human repellent.</i><br>
  My mother wonders what's wrong with me.<br> 

  </div><br><br> 

  <div style="background-color: lightpink;" >
  I don't know what's wrong.<br>
  Or maybe I do. <br>
  I'm bored. <br>
  Maybe I'm craving a <i style="color: hotpink;">girl</i>.<br> 
  I can't help staring at them, <br><br>
  the ones clearing dishes in their parents'eateries, <br><br>
  the uniformed schoolgirls walking hand in hand, <br><br>
  the slim young women who work in the Lotte department store, smelling of fried kimchi
  and <a href="https://www.perfume.com/nina-ricci/l-air-du-temps/women-perfume">L'Air du Temps</a>.<br><br> 
  They're all stunning to me, even with their bad teeth.<br>
  I let myself drift near them, hoping for <br>
  t&nbsp; h&nbsp; e &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s&nbsp; c&nbsp; a&nbsp; n&nbsp; t&nbsp; e&nbsp; s&nbsp; t &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t&nbsp; o&nbsp; u&nbsp; c&nbsp; h.<br>
  </div><br><br>

  <div style="background-color: lightcyan;" >
  But there's nothing. <br>
  I'm too obviously desperate, utterly hopeless.<br> 
  Instead,it seems, I can <b style="color:yellow;-webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px black;">eat</b>. <br> 
  I've always liked food, but now I'm bent on trying everything. <br> <br> 
  As it is, the days are made up of meals, <br>formal and impromptu,<br>meals between meals and within meals; <br>the streets are a continuous outdoor buffet of<br> <b style="color:white;-webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px red;">braised crabs</b>, <br><b style="color:yellow;-webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px brown;">cold buckwheat noodles</b>,<br> <b style="color:white;-webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px blue;">shaved ice </b>with <b style="color:red;-webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px brown;">sweet red beans </b>on top. <br><br>
  In Itaewon, the district near the United States Army base, where you can get anything you want, culinary or otherwise,we stop at a seafood stand for dinner.<br>
  Basically, it's a tent diner, a long bar with stools, a camp stove and fish tank behind the proprietor, an elderly woman with a low, hoarse voice. <br>
  The roof is a stretch of blue poly-tarp.<br>
  My father is excited; it's like the old days. <br>
  He wants <b style="color:salmon;">raw fish</b>, but my mother shakes her head. <br>
  I can see why: in plastic bins of speckled, bloody ice sit semi-alive cockles, abalones, eels, conchs, sea cucumbers, porgies,shrimps.<br>
   "Get something fried," she tells him, not caring what the woman
  might think. "Get something cooked."
  </div><br><br>



  <div style="background-color: forestgreen;color: white;">
  A young couple sitting at the end of the bar order live octopus. <br>
  The old woman nods and hooks one in the tank. <br>
  It's fairly small, the size of a hand.<br> 
  She lays it on a board and quickly slices off the head with her cleaver. <br>
  She chops the tentacles and gathers them up onto a plate, dressing them with
  sesame oil and a spicy bean sauce. <br>
  "You have to be careful," my father whispers, "or one of the suction cups can stick inside your throat. <br>
  <b style="color:">You could die</b>."<br>
  The lovers <i>blithely</i> feed each other the sectioned tentacles, taking sips of soju in between.<br>
  My mother immediately orders a scallion-and-seafood pancake for us, then a spicy cod-head stew; <br>
  my father murmurs that he still wants something <i>live, fresh</i>. <br>
  I point to a bin and saythat's what I want—<br>
  those split spiny spheres, like <b style="color: yellow">cracked-open meteorites</b>, their rusty centers layered with shiny crenellations.<br>
  I bend down and smell them, and my eyes almost water from the intense <b style="color:seagreen;">ocean tang</b>. <br>
  "They're sea urchins," the woman says to my father.<br>
  "He won't like them."<br>
  My mother is telling my father he's crazy, that I'll get sick from food poisoning, <br>
  but he nods to the woman, and she picks up a half and cuts out the soft flesh.
  </div><br><br>


  <div style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;">
  What does it taste like? <br>
  I'm not sure, <br>
  because I've never had anything like it.<br><br>
  All I know is that it tastes <i>alive</i>, <br>
  something alive at the undragged bottom of the sea; <br>
  it tastes the way flesh would taste if <b style="color:lightpink;-webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px brown;">flesh</b> were a mineral. <br><br>
  And I'm half gagging, though still chewing; <br>
  it's as if I had another tongue in my mouth, <br>
  this blind, self-satisfied creature.<br><br>
  That night I <b style="color:darkkhaki;">throw up</b>,<br>
  my mother scolding us, <br>
  my father chuckling through his concern. <br>
  The next day, my uncles joke that they'll take me out for some more,<br>
   and the suggestion is enough to make me retch again.

  </div><br><br>


  <div style="background-color: cornflowerblue;">
  But a week later I'm better, and I go back by myself. <br><br>
  <i>The woman is there</i>,<br>
  and so are the sea urchins, <br>
  <b style="color:yellow;">glistening</b> in the hot sun. <br><br>
  "I know what you want," she says.<br><br>
  I sit, my mouth slick with <b>anticipation and revulsion</b>,<br>
  not yet knowing why.<br>
