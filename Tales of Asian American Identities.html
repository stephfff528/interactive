	<p>Sea Urchin <br>
		By Chang-rae Lee <br> <br>

		July, 1980. I'm about to turn fifteen and our family is in Seoul, the first time since we left, twelve years earlier. I don't know if it's different. My parents can't really say. They just repeat the equivalent of "How in the world?" whenever we venture into another part of the city, or meet one of their old friends. "Look at that — how in the world?" "This hot spell, yes, yes — how in the world?" My younger sister is very quiet in the astounding heat. We all are. It's the first time I notice how I stink. You can't help smelling like everything else. And in the heat everything smells of ferment and rot and rankness. In my grandfather's old neighborhood, where the two- and three-room houses stand barely head-high, the smell is staggering. "What's that?" I ask. My cousin says, "Shit." <br> <br>

		"Shit? What shit?" <br><br>

		"Yours," he says, laughing. "Mine." <br><br>

		On the wide streets near the city center, there are student demonstrations; my cousin says they're a response to a massacre of citizens by the military down south in Kwangju. After the riot troops clear the avenues, the air is laden with tear gas—"spicy," in the idiom. Whenever we're in a taxi, moving through there, I open the window and stick out my tongue, trying to taste the poison, the human repellent. My mother wonders what's wrong with me. <br><br>

		I don't know what's wrong. Or maybe I do. I'm bored. Maybe I'm craving a girl. I can't help staring at them, the ones clearing dishes in their parents' eateries, the uniformed schoolgirls walking hand in hand, the slim young women who work in the Lotte department store, smelling of fried kimchi and L'Air du Temps. They're all stunning to me, even with their bad teeth. I let myself drift near them, hoping for the scantest touch. <br><br>

		But there's nothing. I'm too obviously desperate, utterly hopeless. Instead, it seems, I can eat. I've always liked food, but nowI'm bent on trying everything. As it is, the days are made up of meals, formal and impromptu, meals between meals and within meals; the streets are a continuous outdoor buffet of braised crabs, cold buckwheat noodles, shaved ice with sweet red beans on top. In Itaewon, the district near the United States Army base, where you can get anything you want, culinary or otherwise, we stop at a seafood stand for dinner. Basically, it's a tent diner, a long bar with stools, a camp stove and fish tank behind the proprietor, an elderly woman with a low, hoarse voice. The roof is a stretch of blue poly-tarp. My father is excited; it's like the old days. He wants raw fish, but my mother shakes her head. I can see why: in plastic bins of speckled, bloody ice sit semi-alive cockles, abalones, eels, conchs, sea cucumbers, porgies, shrimps. "Get something fried," she tells him, not caring what the woman might think. "Get something cooked." <br><br> 

		A young couple sitting at the end of the bar order live octopus. The old woman nods and hooks one in the tank. It's fairly small, the size of a hand. She lays it on a board and quickly slices off the head with her cleaver. She chops the tentacles and gathers them up onto a plate, dressing them with sesame oil and a spicy bean sauce. "You have to be careful," my father whispers, "or one of the suction cups can stick inside your throat. You could die." The lovers blithely feed each other the sectioned tentacles, taking sips of soju in between. My mother immediately orders a scallion- and-seafood pancake for us, then a spicy cod-head stew; my father murmurs that he still wants something live, fresh. I point to a bin and say that's what I want—those split spiny spheres, like cracked-open meteorites, their rusty centers layered with shiny crenellations. I bend down and smell them, and my eyes almost water from the intense ocean tang. "They're sea urchins," the woman says to my father. "He won't like them." My mother is telling my father he's crazy, that I'll get sick from food poisoning, but he nods to the woman, and she picks up a half and cuts out the soft flesh. <br><br> 

		What does it taste like? I'm not sure, because I've never had anything like it. All I know is that it tastes alive, something alive at the undragged bottom of the sea; it tastes the way flesh would taste if flesh were a mineral. And I'm half gagging, though still chewing; it's as if I had another tongue in my mouth, this blind, self-satisfied creature. That night I throw up, my mother scolding us, my father chuckling through his concern. The next day, my uncles joke that they'll take me out for some more, and the suggestion is enough to make me retch again. <br><br> 

		But a week later I'm better, and I go back by myself. The woman is there, and so are the sea urchins, glistening in the hot sun. "I know what you want," she says. I sit, my mouth slick with anticipation and revulsion, not yet knowing why. <br><br><br><br><br><br> 

		Crying in H Mart<br> 
		By Michelle Zauner<br><br> 

		Ever since my mom died, I cry in H Mart. For those of you who don’t know, H Mart is a supermarket chain that specializes in Asian food. The “H” stands for han ah reum, a Korean phrase that roughly translates to “one arm full of groceries.” H Mart is where parachute kids go to get the exact brand of instant noodles that reminds them of home. It’s where Korean families buy rice cakes to make tteokguk, a beef soup that brings in the new year. It’s the only place where you can find a giant vat of peeled garlic, because it’s the only place that truly understands how much garlic you’ll need for the kind of food your people eat. H Mart is freedom from the single-aisle “ethnic” section in regular grocery stores. They don’t prop Goya beans next to bottles of sriracha here. Instead, you’ll likely find me crying by the banchan refrigerators, remembering the taste of my mom’s soy-sauce eggs and cold radish soup. Or in the freezer section, holding a stack of dumpling skins, thinking of all the hours that Mom and I spent at the kitchen table folding minced pork and chives into the thin dough. Sobbing near the dry goods, asking myself, “Am I even Korean anymore if there’s no one left in my life to call and ask which brand of seaweed we used to buy?” <br><br> 

		When I was growing up, with a Caucasian father and a Korean mother, my mom was my access point for our Korean heritage. While she never actually taught me how to cook (Korean people tend to disavow measurements and supply only cryptic instructions along the lines of “add sesame oil until it tastes like Mom’s”), she did raise me with a distinctly Korean appetite. This meant an over-the-top appreciation of good food and emotional eating. We were particular about everything: kimchi had to be perfectly sour, samgyupsal perfectly crisped; hot food had to be served piping hot or it might as well be inedible. The concept of prepping meals for the week was a ludicrous affront to our life style. We chased our cravings daily. If we wanted the same kimchi stew for three weeks straight, we relished it until a new craving emerged. We ate in accordance with the seasons and holidays. On my birthday, she’d make seaweed soup: a traditional dish for celebrating one’s mother that is also what women typically eat after giving birth. When spring arrived and the weather turned, we’d bring our camp stove outdoors and fry up strips of fresh pork belly on the deck. In many ways, food was how my mother expressed her love. No matter how critical or cruel she seemed—constantly pushing me to be what she felt was the best version of myself—I could always feel her affection radiating from the lunches she packed and the meals she prepared for me just the way I liked them.<br><br>

		I can hardly speak Korean, but in H Mart I feel like I’m fluent. I fondle the produce and say the words aloud—chamoe melon, danmuji. I fill my shopping cart with every snack that has glossy packaging decorated with a familiar cartoon. I think about the time Mom showed me how to fold the little plastic card that came inside bags of Jolly Pong, how to use it as a spoon to shovel caramel puff rice into my mouth, and how it inevitably fell down my shirt and spread all over the car. I remember the snacks Mom told me she ate when she was a kid and how I tried to imagine her at my age. I wanted to like all the things she did, to embody her completely.<br><br>

		My grief comes in waves and is usually triggered by something arbitrary. I can tell you with a straight face what it was like watching my mom’s hair fall out in the bathtub, or about the five weeks I spent sleeping in hospitals, but catch me at H Mart when some kid runs up double-fisting plastic sleeves of ppeong-twigi and I’ll just lose it. Those little rice-cake Frisbees were my childhood: a happier time, when Mom was there and we’d crunch away on the Styrofoam-like disks after school. Eating them was like splitting a packing peanut that dissolved like sugar on your tongue.<br><br> 

		I’ll cry when I see a Korean grandmother eating seafood noodles in the food court, discarding shrimp heads and mussel shells onto the lid of her daughter’s tin rice bowl. Her gray hair frizzy, cheekbones protruding like the tops of two peaches, tattooed eyebrows rusting as the ink fades out. I’ll wonder what my Mom would have looked like in her seventies—if she would have the same perm that every Korean grandma gets as though it were a part of our race’s evolution. I’ll imagine our arms linked, her tiny frame leaning against mine as we take the escalator up to the food court. The two of us in all black, “New York style,” she’d say, her image of New York still rooted in the era of “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” She would carry the quilted-leather Chanel purse that she’d wanted her whole life, instead of the fake ones that she bought on the back streets of Itaewon. Her hands and face would be slightly sticky from QVC anti-aging creams. She’d wear some strange, ultra-high-top sneaker wedges that I’d disagree with. “Michelle, in Korea, every celebrity wears this one.” She’d pluck the lint off my coat and pick on me—how my shoulders slumped, how I needed new shoes, how I should really start using that argan-oil treatment she bought me—but we’d be together.<br><br> 


		If I’m being honest, there’s a lot of anger. I’m angry at this old Korean woman I don’t know, that she gets to live and my mother does not, like somehow this stranger’s survival is at all related to my loss. Why is she here slurping up spicy jjamppong noodles and my mom isn’t? Other people must feel this way. Life is unfair, and sometimes it helps to irrationally blame someone for it. <br><br>

		Sometimes my grief feels as though I’ve been left alone in a room with no doors. Every time I remember that my mother is dead, it feels like I’m colliding into a wall that won’t give. There’s no escape, just a hard wall that I keep ramming into over and over, a reminder of the immutable reality that I will never see her again.<br><br>

		H Marts are usually situated far from a city’s center. When I lived in Brooklyn, it was an hour-long drive in traffic to Flushing. In Philly, it’s about the same to Upper Darby or Elkins Park. H Marts often serve as the center of larger complexes of Asian storefronts, and are surrounded by Asian restaurants that are always better than the ones found closer to town. We’re talking Korean restaurants that pack the table so full of banchan side dishes that you’re forced to play a never-ending game of horizontal Jenga with twenty-plus plates of tiny anchovies, stuffed cucumbers, and pickled everything. This isn’t like the sad Asian-fusion joint by your work, where they serve bell peppers in their bibimbap and give you the stink eye when you ask for another round of wilted bean sprouts; this is the real deal. <br><br> 

		You’ll know that you’re headed the right way because there will be signs to mark your path. As you go farther into your pilgrimage, the lettering on the awnings slowly begins to turn into symbols that you may or may not be able to read. This is when my elementary-grade Korean skills are put to the test—how fast can I sound out the vowels while in traffic? I spent more than ten years going to hangul hakkyo every Friday, and this is all I have to show for it: I can read the signs for churches in different Asian texts, for an optometrist’s office, a bank. A couple more blocks in, and we’re in the heart of it. Suddenly, it’s like another country. Everyone is Asian, a swarm of different dialects crisscross like invisible telephone wires, the only English words are “HOT POT” and “LIQUORS,” and they’re all buried beneath a handful of different characters, with an anime tiger or hot dog dancing next to them.<br><br> 

		Inside an H Mart complex, there will be some kind of food court, an appliance shop, and a pharmacy. Usually, there’s a beauty counter where you can buy Korean makeup and skin-care products with snail mucin or caviar oil, or a face mask that proudly and vaguely advertises “PLACENTA.” (Whose placenta? Who knows?) There will usually be a pseudo-French bakery with weak coffee, bubble tea, and an array of glowing pastries that always look much better than they taste. <br><br> 


		Lately, my local H Mart is in Cheltenham, a town northeast of Philadelphia. My routine is to drive in for lunch on the weekends, stock up on groceries for the week, and cook something for dinner with whatever fresh bounty inspired me. The H Mart in Cheltenham has two stories; the grocery is on the first floor and the food court is above it. Upstairs, there is an array of stalls for different kinds of food. One is dedicated to sushi, one is strictly Chinese, and another is for traditional Korean jjigaes, bubbling soups served in traditional stone pots called dolsots, which act as mini cauldrons to insure that your soup is still bubbling a good ten minutes past arrival. There’s a stall for Korean street food, which serves up Korean ramen (which basically just means Shin Cup Noodles with an egg cracked in them); giant steamed dumplings full of pork and glass noodles, housed in a thick, cake-like dough; and tteokbokki, chewy, bite-sized cylindrical rice cakes boiled in a stock with fishcakes, red pepper, and gochujang, a sweet-and-spicy paste that’s one of the three mother sauces used in pretty much all Korean dishes. Last, there’s my personal favorite: Korean-Chinese fusion, which serves tangsuyuk—a glossy, sweet-and-sour orange pork—seafood noodle soup, fried rice, and jajangmyeon.<br><br> 

		The food court is the perfect place to people-watch while sucking down salty, fatty, black-bean noodles. I think about my family who lived in Korea, before most of them died, and how Korean-Chinese food was always the first thing we’d eat when my mom and I arrived in Seoul after a fourteen-hour flight from America. Twenty minutes after my aunt would phone in our order, the apartment ringer would buzz “Für Elise” in midi, and up would come a helmeted man, fresh off his motorcycle, with a giant steel box. He’d slide open the metal door and deliver heaping bowls of noodles and deep-fried battered pork with its rich sauce on the side. The Saran wrap on top would be concave and sweating. We’d peel it off and dribble black, chunky goodness all over the noodles and pour the shiny, sticky, translucent orange sauce over the pork. We’d sit cross-legged on the cool marble floor, slurping and reaching over one another. My aunts and mom and grandmother would jabber on in Korean, and I would eat and listen, unable to comprehend, bothering my mom every so often to translate.<br><br> 

		I wonder how many people at H Mart miss their families. How many are thinking of them as they bring their trays back from the different stalls. Whether they’re eating to feel connected, to celebrate these people through food. Which ones weren’t able to fly back home this year, or for the past ten years? Which ones are like me, missing the people who are gone from their lives forever?<br><br> 

		At one table is a group of young Chinese students, alone without family at schools in America. They have banded together to take the bus forty-five minutes outside the city, into the suburbs of a foreign country, for soup dumplings. At another table, there are three generations of Korean women eating three types of stews: daughter, mom, and grandmother dipping their spoons into each other’s dolsots, reaching over one another’s trays, arms in one another’s faces, pinching at their different banchan with chopsticks. None of them pay any notice or give second thought to the concept of personal space.<br><br> 

		There is a young white man and his family. They giggle together as they butcher the pronunciation of the menu. The son explains to his parents the different dishes they’ve ordered. Maybe he was stationed in Seoul for military service or taught English abroad. Maybe he’s the only one in his family with a passport. Maybe this will be the moment his family decides it’s time to travel and discover these things themselves.<br><br> 

		There is an Asian guy blowing his girlfriend’s mind, introducing her to a whole new world of flavors and textures. He shows her how to eat mul naengmyeon, a cold noodle soup that tastes better if you add vinegar and hot mustard first. He tells her about how his parents came to this country, how he’d watch his mom make this dish. When she made it, she didn’t add zucchini; she subbed radishes instead. An old man hobbles over to a neighboring table to order the chicken-and-ginseng porridge that he probably eats here every day. Bells go off for people to collect their orders. Women in visors work behind the counters without stopping.<br><br> 

		It’s a beautiful, holy place. A cafeteria full of people from all over the world who have been displaced in a foreign country, each with a different history. Where did they come from and how far did they travel? Why are they all here? To find the galangal no American supermarket stocks to make the Indonesian curry that their father loves? To buy the rice cakes to celebrate Jesa and honor the anniversary of their loved one’s passing? To satisfy a craving for tteokbokki on a rainy day? Were they moved by a memory of some drunken, late-night snack under a pojangmacha tent in Incheon?<br><br> 

		We don’t talk about it. There’s never so much as a knowing look. We sit here in silence, eating our lunch. But I know we are all here for the same reason. We’re all searching for a piece of home, or a piece of ourselves. We look for a taste of it in the food we order and the ingredients we buy. Then we separate. We bring the haul back to our dorm rooms or suburban kitchens, and we re-create a dish that couldn’t be made without that journey, because what we’re looking for isn’t accessible at a Trader Joe’s. H Mart is where you can find your people under one odorous roof, where you can have faith that you’ll find something you can’t find anywhere else.<br><br> 

		In the H Mart food court, I find myself again, searching for the first chapter of the story that I want to tell about my mother. I am sitting next to a Korean mother and her son, who have unknowingly taken the table next to ol’ waterworks over here. The kid dutifully gets their silverware from the counter and places it on paper napkins for the both of them. He’s eating fried rice and his mom has seolleongtang, ox-bone soup. He must be in his early twenties, but his mother is still instructing him on how to eat, just like my mom used to. “Dip the onion in the paste.” “Don’t add too much gochujang or it’ll be too salty.” “Why aren’t you eating the mung beans?” Some days, the constant nagging would annoy me. Woman, let me eat in peace! But, most days, I knew it was the ultimate display of a Korean woman’s tenderness, and I cherished that love.<br><br> 

		The boy’s mom places pieces of beef from her spoon onto his spoon. He is quiet and looks tired and doesn’t talk to her much. I want to tell him how much I miss my mother. How he should be kind to his mom, remember that life is fragile and she could be gone at any moment. Tell her to go to the doctor and make sure there isn’t a small tumor growing inside her. <br><br> 

		Within the past five years, I lost both my aunt and mother to cancer. So, when I go to H Mart, I’m not just on the hunt for cuttlefish and three bunches of scallions for a buck; I’m searching for their memory. I’m collecting the evidence that the Korean half of my identity didn’t die when they did. In moments like this, H Mart is the bridge that guides me away from the memories that haunt me, of chemo head and skeletal bodies and logging milligrams of hydrocodone. It reminds me of who they were before: beautiful and full of life, wiggling Chang Gu honey-cracker rings on all ten of their fingers, showing me how to suck a Korean grape from its skin and spit out the seeds.<br><br><br><br><br><br> 


		Chronicles of a Bubble-Tea Addict<br> 
		By Jiayang Fan<br><br> 

		I first discovered zhen zhu nai cha, as bubble milk tea, or boba, is known in Chinese, when I was ten. It was the early nineties, and I’d been in the United States only two years, living and going to school in Connecticut towns so uniformly white that soy sauce was still considered exotic there. A few times a year, my mother and I would take the Metro-North an hour south to New York City for the sole purpose of stockpiling Chinese groceries. These were not leisurely shopping trips but carefully strategized plans of attack, during which my mother practiced bargain-hunting as blood sport. Behind her I’d trudge, up Canal and down East Broadway, a weary foot soldier weighed down by growing satchels of fish tofu and Chinese cabbage and hoisin sauce. Invariably, our last stop was Taipan Bakery, which offered an end-of-day discount on goods such as red-bean buns and sponge cake, my favorites. At some point, it also began selling a newfangled drink, served in plastic cups with jumbo straws and what appeared to be shiny marbles piled on the bottom. An order cost about three dollars, half of my mother’s hourly wage cleaning houses. Yet every time she relented and let me buy one, and the victory tasted as sweet as the drink itself. <br><br>


		There was only one flavor of boba back then—black tea with sweetened condensed milk and balls of tapioca—and the cups had annoyingly flimsy lids that leaked at the slightest jostle. This provided a solid excuse to sit down at one of the bakery’s unwiped chrome-rimmed tables, where I’d sip my tea and indulge in my second-favorite activity in Chinatown: people-watching. It didn’t matter that the bits of chatter I picked up were not exactly juicy—the crowd at Taipan was mostly elderly grandmas or weary parents and their children—or that I had to contend with my mother’s complaints about my indulgence. (“Why are we wasting money when I can just pour sugar and gummies in your tea?”) What I savored was the illusion, ever so rare for a bewildered young immigrant, that we, too, could afford a few pearls of leisure.<br><br> 

		At school, a fancy one that my mother toiled to afford, we were reading “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” Betty Smith’s semi-autobiographical novel about a family fighting indigence and hard luck in early-twentieth-century Williamsburg. Francie Nolan, the teen-aged protagonist—nerdy, plain, and secretly ambitious, like me—loved the smell of coffee, one of the family’s few luxuries, but she seldom drank her serving—“at the end of the meal, it went down the sink.” It was Francie’s mother’s comment, in particular, that stayed with me: “I think it’s good that people like us can waste something once in a while and get the feeling of how it would be to have lots of money and not have to worry about scrounging.” Unlike Francie, though, I gulped down king-sized cups of boba without leaving behind a single drop. When only melting ice cubes remained, I hunted the last tapioca balls stranded among them as if on a search-and-rescue mission, and savored how their gummy vestiges would remain stuck in my molars long after I’d thrown the empty cup away. <br><br>


		Like me, bubble tea was a recent immigrant to the U.S. It had originated, sometime in the eighties, amid the vibrant snack culture of Taiwan, although exactly how and when is a matter of dispute. One story goes that a Taichung tea house whimsically blended iced black tea with fen yuan, a traditional Taiwanese dessert of sweetened tapioca pudding, only to discover that the combo outsold every other offering. It wasn’t long before the new beverage traveled overseas with the waves of immigrants from Taiwan who were arriving on California’s shores; before there were specialty boba shops, Taiwanese restaurants would offer it as an off-menu item for those in the know. Today bubble tea is rampant in China (the term “boba” is also Chinese slang for “big breasts,” though the name isn’t popular on the mainland), but the Taiwan–U.S. pipeline is how the trend first traveled. When I went back to China as a kid, during summer vacations, I was astonished to discover that my extended family living in third- and fourth-tier cities had never even tasted the drink. <br><br> 


		If it were up to me, my mother and I would have moved next door to Taipan Bakery, and I could have grown up on a diet of tapioca, gawking at the Chinese-American boys with their gelled hair and baggy denim. (At twelve, I crushed hard on the “wannabe gangsta” look.) But my mother knew, in a way a child could not, that a life in New York would have also meant life in government-subsidized housing, in an urban school district whose quality she couldn’t ascertain. It was better for us to be interlopers among affluent strangers while quietly chipping away at the American dream. <br><br> 


		After college, in 2007, I moved to New York, and lived in stamp-sized apartments on the Upper East Side and in Murray Hill—neighborhoods dominated by the élite, white demographic of my youth. But four years later my mother was diagnosed with A.L.S., a progressive, neurodegenerative illness that was destined to paralyze every voluntary muscle of her body. She was still living in Connecticut, working the same nanny job she’d had for a decade; the prospect of losing independence petrified her. But the disease left her with few options; her doctor warned that she would need a caretaker. So she scoured New York City for affordable apartments that the two of us could share, employing the same hard-nosed diligence she applied to grocery shopping, and settled on a place in Elmhurst, Queens, one of the most diverse and immigrant-dense neighborhoods in the city. I would have preferred a newer building with fewer cockroaches in the kitchen sink and a more handicap-friendly lobby, but it did not escape my notice that there were two bubble-tea parlors within a five-minute walk of our apartment. <br><br> 


		Ten Ren, on Elmhurst’s main drag, was an old-timey place specializing in loose-leaf tea in gilded canisters. Founded in Taiwan, in 1953, by the son of a tea-farming family, it had introduced boba as the trend accelerated in the late nineties. There, I’d skip milk tea in favor of the classics—ginseng oolong and High Mountain tie guan yin, which had a quietly earthy fragrance. The place reminded me of my childhood in China, with middle-aged saleswomen who spoke no English and cracked sunflower seeds between their teeth. A block away, the second shop, Quickly, delivered me into another scene entirely. Founded in Southern California, in 2002, by a Taiwanese entrepreneur who billed her café as “New Generation Asian Fusion,” Quickly offered pearl milk tea in Americanized flavors—chocolate and coffee and caramel—and simplified the operation, doing away with traditional hot brewed teas altogether. I patronized Quickly more often, because it was closer to my subway stop and because, in the right mood, I enjoyed a coffee-flavored tea instead of my usual taro. Waiting for my order to arrive, I’d watch coteries of Asian teen-agers slip in and out, laughing and chatting in a mixture of Chinese idioms and English slang. <br><br>

		The contrast between Ten Ren and Quickly was the first sign, for me, that the world of bubble tea was changing. Riding the wave of upscale coffee bars, boba shops in the following years would proliferate, moving outside ethnic enclaves to claim real estate on main city thoroughfares. Before the pandemic engulfed New York, I liked to travel forty-five minutes from where I live now, in Harlem, to St. Marks Place, which boasted, at one time, six bubble-tea shops on a single block. I am well into my thirties, but in my sweats and sneakers I’d convince myself that I could pass for one of the Gen Z students who are increasingly the target boba demographic, even if the panoply of novel bubble-tea offerings felt increasingly estranged from the drink as I knew it. Why go to a boba shop if you want panna cotta, or chia seeds in place of tapioca balls? My favorite haunt, Mi Tea, a spacious, well-lit outpost of a Chinese chain, specialized in “cheese tea,” a viral sensation featuring layers of foamy milk and salty whipped cream cheese. The drink, which originated in a Taiwanese night market around 2010, costs anywhere between five and eight dollars a cup, but before the pandemic, when I’d hunker in Mi Tea working for hours at a time, I’d notice many orders abandoned half-consumed on unoccupied tables. This was an altogether different kind of waste than what Francie practiced with her coffee. Boba and I had spent our adolescence as scrappy, enterprising immigrants at America’s periphery. But it had evolved into something different: the boba shop was now a sort of social club for Asian youth, a snacky sanctuary of belonging, and bubble tea a ubiquitous, Instagram-friendly accessory for a new generation of upwardly mobile Asian kids. <br><br>

		In 2018, boba’s new status was enshrined in a Facebook group called Subtle Asian Traits, a forum created, as a lark, by Asian-Australian high-schoolers, to collect observations and memes about the Asian diaspora. Along with experiences such as strict parents, or a familiarity with the question “Where are you really from?,” a fondness for bubble tea was, according to the group, a signature trait of Asian youth; one meme shows an Asian baby being baptized with bubble tea instead of holy water. The phenomenon of Subtle Asian Traits, which has since swelled into one of the Internet’s largest Asian communities, with almost two million members (and has inspired such spinoff groups as Subtle Asian Leftovers and Subtle Asian Dating), suggests how hungry young Asians were to find a knowing, unifying language of their shared experience. Reading through the group’s posts, I felt as if I were at one of the middle-school sleepovers I’d never got invited to as a kid, laughing at insidery jokes whose punchlines, for once, did not have to be explained. By publicly cataloguing the habits and quirks of Asian identity, though, Subtle Asian Traits in effect, perhaps inadvertently, issued a definition of what—and, by extension, who—counts as Asian. The group became a subject of debate, criticized for being élitist and skewed toward the East Asian experience, and for otherwise treating a narrow, consumerist version of Asian-ness as somehow universal. In a long piece about boba for Eater, from 2019, the writer and critic Jenny G. Zhang wrote that “there is something irredeemably maddening” about defining one’s cultural identity in terms of commodified objects, “as young Asian Americans have done with bubble tea.” <br><br> 


		On social media, such frustrations had found expression in a new coinage, a sort of intra-Asian put-down for the bubble-tea generation: “boba liberalism.” According to the Twitter user @diaspora_is_red, an Asian-American who was among the first to use the term, a boba liberal is someone who centers her Asian identity in buzzy cultural objects and “trend-chasing spectacle” but lacks true engagement with the politics of her Asian identity. It’s the Asian who can’t stop talking about “Crazy Rich Asians” as a breakthrough in Asian representation, or who posts boba selfies as a way to prove her Asian bona fides while, elsewhere, seeking acceptance within white culture. For the boba liberal, politics is as much a performance as is one’s choice of beverage, a cultural prop in the theatre of identity. I had seen the label lobbed back and forth on social media, but I never paid it much mind, until, last October, I noticed it attached to my own name. I had written a food diary for New York’s Grub Street, in which I mentioned enjoying, among many other Asian (and occasionally non-Asian) foods, boba in popsicle form. A few days after the article came out, I discovered, to my bemusement, that a fellow Asian-American had linked to it on Twitter, with the caption “boba lib idiot queen.”I am admittedly vocal about my obsession with bubble tea; in fact, the editors of the Grub Street piece had cut several other mentions of it, on the ground that it was boba overkill. I also write for a mainstream, left-leaning American publication, and it’s true that I once wrote a Profile of the “Crazy Rich Asians” star Constance Wu. It hadn’t occurred to me that such proclivities made me a quintessential boba liberal (much less an idiot queen)—aren’t I too old, anyway, to be implicated in a younger generation’s negotiations over the meaning of bubble tea? But my intentions don’t quite matter; as my mother has always been fond of reminding me, an identity is as much about how you are perceived as it is about what you mean to project. <br><br> 


		The boba-liberal label made me think back to my first year of college in New England, when I joined an Asian-American campus organization. (Another hallmark of the boba liberal: placing excessive value in Asian student groups.) The first Chinese-American I encountered at the group’s meeting had been born in the U.S. Another didn’t speak Chinese at all. They were comfortably middle-class, with parents who worked white-collar jobs. I don’t recall much about our activities—I had been appointed the P.R. rep, a role I performed lackadaisically at best—except that, at a campus-wide spring-festival event, we decided unanimously to offer bubble tea as a way of “sharing our Asian-American heritage.” Looking back, I wonder whether serving this ostensibly exotic drink to our predominantly white classmates effectively engaged their cultural curiosity, or whether it was exactly the kind of superficial, flattening display of Asian-ness that the term boba liberal was coined to critique—“all sugar, no substance,” as @diaspora_is_red put it. <br><br> 

		On the other hand, a group of college freshmen could be forgiven for assuming that compromising our complexity was a condition of survival as minorities in a majority world. Part of being Asian-American—a subtle trait, if you want to call it that—is the fear of being judged for losing one’s Asian-ness while failing to earn acceptance as a real American. Assimilation, in other words, is an impossible process of pouring oneself into another while holding onto a sense of self. It is tricky to judge from the outside a transformation that largely takes place within.<br><br> 

		The whole trajectory of my life in America has involved navigating cultural symbols, most of which were far more intimidating than boba. When I was young, my mother thumbed through the U.S. News & World Report college rankings as if it were the Bible, until its pages went dirty and ragged. She knew that an élite education functioned as a trophy on the mantel of cultural capital, and that accruing me such capital was the surest way to insure my success in this country. It was only years later, once I’d achieved the higher education she’d painstakingly engineered for me, that I recognized how my mother’s diligence was intertwined with a deep cynicism, a search for validation in a world whose ingrained racism and structural inequities she accepted as inevitable. What arrogance must I possess, she’d say, to believe that the system could change? Better to learn the rules of the game and submit. Practice this sort of pragmatism long enough and it becomes a kind of complicity: everything is merely a performance, a bending of oneself to the warped shape of America. And yet, my mother’s very journey to this country was a gamble premised on the possibility of change.<br><br>

		In adulthood, I’ve sought out boba most obsessively during the times when my life has felt most beyond my control. As the roles reversed between my mother and me, something about the syrupy, caramelized milk fortified—or perhaps anesthetized—me against the sight of her shrinking body, which weakened a little every day until she could no longer survive without a hospital’s round-the-clock care. The day she had a feeding tube inserted, because she’d lost the ability to swallow, I nursed a green milk tea with red beans and tapioca balls while waiting for the liquid food supplement to drain into her stomach. See, we both have our zhen zhu nai cha, I told her. Last March, when the pandemic hit New York City, and it was unclear whether I’d be able to continue visiting my mother at the medical facility where she lives, I hurried down to Chinatown to stock up on quarantine groceries. A rainbow-colored package that had never tempted me before suddenly called out: black tapioca pearl, ready in five minutes! I threw it into my shopping cart and hoped that I would not have to resort to using it. <br><br> 


		The packet spent most of last year deep in the recesses of my kitchen cabinet, among my collection of dried seaweed and pickled tofu. To pass the fearful, lonely months of quarantine, I splurged on boba delivery, often several cups at a time. (When I went for an endoscopy recently, the first of my life, a mysterious gummy substance was detected in my gut.) But one night in December, too late to order in, I was overcome by the familiar craving. I fished out the emergency boba provisions and tore open the package. The shriveled balls inside looked like rat droppings, with a whitish powder clinging to their surface. Dismayed that I hadn’t checked the expiration date at the time of purchase, as my mother would have surely done, I saw that the tapioca had expired some months ago. I Googled the dangers of consuming expired bubbles and was assured, by an entry on a site called talkboba.com, that “if you consume expired tapioca starch or other starches and flours, you most likely won’t get sick.” Good enough. I took a handful of the pebbles, dropped them into a pot, and turned on the stove. The balls vibrated in the water as they became bloated, and took on a transparent sheen. A thick honey smell filled the air. Before they were fully cooked, I couldn’t resist scooping out a spoonful, gulping them down so quickly that I could feel their dark, sticky heat long after I swallowed.
